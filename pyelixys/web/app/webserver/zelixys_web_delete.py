'''
This python file handles all DELETE requests from
a client.

Class imports:
-all flask components needed
-basicauth which allows user/pw vertification
-get current client state to obtain the client state
from the DB
-the database and sequence manager variables from
'web_service.py'
-the GET /state handler from 'elixys_web_get.py'

The variable "current_app" is used to log all events.

        Function handles a DELETE request from a web request
        in the form of:
        DELETE /Elixys/sequence/<sequenceid>/component/<componentid>
        Function expects two parameters, both integers, that are passed
        in from the web request.
        Function will delete the given sequence's component by it's id
        on the database. Function shall also update the client state
        by moving to the previous component on the "Edit Sequence"
        screen on the client.
        Function shall return the output of GET /Elixys/state.
